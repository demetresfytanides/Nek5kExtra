# Simple Cube Example

1. run the smoother over z0.rea. 
   The streamwise and spanwise boundary is "SYM" and the top "O  ".
   These are later replaces with "   " and "SYM" for the file z1 required for mkreal
2. I tried both the classic smoother with no "surface smoothing" (smoother.usr) and the surface smoothign routine (surface.usr)
